# Alone with Boxes

  A visual coding simulator in progress using Unity. The idea is that you're piloting the inner workings of a computer that can sense the outside world. Though you don't know much coding, you have pretty much infinite time and resources to make sense of what's coming in and understand what happened.
  
  So far, I have continuous input, command parsing, and submission history complete with simple box art. The future of this project will include more meaningful levels, a tutorial character, and a main menu home base.
